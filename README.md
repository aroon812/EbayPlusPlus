Notes:

The third iteration of the website has added much more functionality. We now have a user page that allows a user to edit their information, as well as keep track of items they have listed, and those they want to bid on. We also now have a working framework for private messaging. We hope to add more functionality and style to the template, but as of now we are returning messages to closed pairs of users.

Notes:
The first iteration has largely consisted of the creation of the items module for eBay++. The items module is functioning as our listings and search page, similar to what is seen on ebay. While our search is much more limited, we do have the ability to search through all available items in our database to find the item of your choice. When a user is logged in (read: has admin permission) they are able to create an item, as well as bid on an item. Both actions are associated with that specific users ObjectId, which will be used for later functionality. - Jared Polonitzas
